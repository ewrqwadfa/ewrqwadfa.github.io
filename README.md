    <p>answers to the questions</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the internet infrastructure that connects everything around the world</li>
      <li>the client requests things while the server provides them</li>
      <li>they act as the physical infrastructure of the internet</li>
      <li>the tcp/ip model acts as a framework for communication, providing standardized reliable addressing and transmission</li>
      <li>websites, downloads, communication</li>
      <li>hypertext is a system of non-linear text containing hyperlinks that link to other similar sections</li>
      <li>the internet is the infrastructure while the web is the content</li>
      <li>it uses a stateless request and response system where the client requests something and the server validates and responds</li>
      <li>http transfers all data in plaintext, while https encrypts it first (https is just a secure http)</li>
      <li>the web developed from being mostly read-only (web 1.0), to allowing writing and socialization (web 2.0), to finally including ownership and personalization (web 3.0)</li>
      <li>kinda same as above</li>
      <li>markup languages structure and format websites, but also define things using tags making data transport, documentation, and other things possible</li>
      <li>scripting languages execute things, while markup languages cover both loose ends (provide the structure to allow scripting to work, and also appearance and customization)</li>
      <li>they are all very similar markup languages used in web development</li>
      <li>i dont have much prior experience with client sided scripting but it would be interesting and helpful to learn</li>
      <li>adding on to the above, it would be helpful to learn because many coding or office jobs may require or would be benefitted by having knowledge of client side scripting</li>
